  <h2>JAZZ</h2>
<p style="margin-top:30px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz" target="_blank" title="Jazz-Wikipedia"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> is a music genre originating from the black community of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
<br>
The rhythm, fraying, sound, and blues harmonies of jazz come from the sense of African music and the unique sense of music of black Americans, and the instruments, melodies, and harmonies used follow traditional European methods.
<br>
It was from the 1910s came to be called jazz and before that it was commonly referred to as <strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime" target= "_blank" title= "Ragtime-Wikipedia">ragtime music</a></u></strong> or <strong><u>rag</u></strong>.</p>

<p style="margin-top:30px;">The characteristics of jazz include three things: the creativity and vitality of the offbeat rhythm, the sound and framing that make up a lot of the personality of the performer, and these are fundamentally different from European and classical music.
  <br>
Jazz is rooted in West African cultural and musical expressions and African-American musical traditions.</p>
